Overview of the project: image Experiment: LED BLINKING WITH ARDUINO
Objective: The main objective of this experiment to learn the basics of the microcontroller using the Arduino.
Apparatus: Microcontroller of Arduino board USB B cable LED Resistor(1kohm) Jumper wires Battery Power Source Working 
Procedure: *After completing software installation and coding upload unplug the board. *Connect output pin number of Arduino board with resistor. *Connect resistor with positive terminal of LED. *Connect negative terminal of LED withground pin of Arduino. *Supply power to Arduino board board by USB B wire or external power port 
Precautions: *All the connections should be tight and proper. *Handle the Arduino board carefully. *Check connections again before program starts to execute. *Switch of the Arduino board after performing the experiment. 
Result: After executing the programming the LED connected to the Arduino board will glow when it is high.# CODTECH-Task1
